# ConfigMgr-Client-Health-Hacks
This Code does not belong to me, I just really needed to add some features and keep track of them all. Hope to convert the real Author to Github https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/ConfigMgr-Client-Health-ccd00bd7

# Todo or To Cleanup:
Look into writing a better log function that can also be configured by config xml to be cmtrace compatible or a "legacy" log.
Create support for simple rest api so that we can avoid the SQL statements.
Maybe add Conditional release of configuration settings from XML based on host parameters/registry/wmi/wql.
Really stop hacking on stuff and actually produce code I like.
